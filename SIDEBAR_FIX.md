# Sidebar Fix - Interview Page

## Issue
When starting an interview, the sidebar was showing the old sidebar from `InterviewAgentUI` instead of the new consistent sidebar from the `Layout` component.

## Root Cause
The App.jsx was completely replacing the Router and Layout with the old `InterviewAgentUI` component when an interview was active:

```javascript
// Before (WRONG)
if (activeInterview) {
  return <InterviewAgentUI preselectedInterview={activeInterview} />;
}

return (
  <Router>
    <Layout>
      <Routes>...</Routes>
    </Layout>
  </Router>
);
```

This meant:
- ❌ Old sidebar appeared during interviews
- ❌ Different navigation experience
- ❌ Inconsistent UI between pages and interview

## Solution

### Step 1: Created New InterviewPage Component
Created `/src/pages/InterviewPage.jsx` - a clean interview component without its own sidebar.

**Features:**
- Clean, modern interview interface
- Progress bar showing completion
- Question navigation
- Answer input
- All questions preview
- Interview tips section
- Matches the design of other pages

### Step 2: Updated App.jsx Structure
Changed to keep the Layout persistent and conditionally render InterviewPage:

```javascript
// After (CORRECT)
return (
  <Router>
    <Layout>
      {activeInterview ? (
        <InterviewPage interview={activeInterview} onExit={...} />
      ) : (
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<MockInterviews />} />
          <Route path="/custom" element={<CustomInterviews />} />
          {/* ... */}
        </Routes>
      )}
    </Layout>
  </Router>
);
```

Now:
- ✅ Same sidebar throughout the entire app
- ✅ Consistent navigation experience
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Files Created

### `/src/pages/InterviewPage.jsx`
New component for the interview experience:
- Accepts `interview`, `onExit`, and `t` (translations) props
- No sidebar - just the content
- Clean, modern UI with:
  - Close button (exits to previous page)
  - Interview header with progress
  - Current question display
  - Answer input area
  - Next/Finish button
  - All questions preview

## Files Modified

### `/src/App.jsx`
1. **Removed**: Old conditional that replaced everything with `InterviewAgentUI`
2. **Added**: Import for `InterviewPage`
3. **Updated**: Structure to keep Layout persistent
4. **Changed**: Conditional rendering to show `InterviewPage` within Layout

## Before vs After

### Before:
```
User starts interview
  ↓
App returns <InterviewAgentUI />
  ↓
Old sidebar with different navigation

```

### After:
```

  ↓
App keeps <Layout> and shows <InterviewPage />

Same look and feel
