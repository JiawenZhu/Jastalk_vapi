{
  "requestMetadata": {
    "userId": "interview-agent-user",
    "sessionId": "session-1234567890",
    "domain": "localhost"
  },
  "searchMode": "JOB_SEARCH",
  "jobQuery": {
    "query": "Software Engineer",
    "locationFilters": [{
      "address": "San Francisco, CA"
    }]
  },
  "maxPageSize": 20

}
```

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - Never commit `.env` to version control
   - `.env` is in `.gitignore`
   - Use restricted API keys in production

2. **Client-Side API Calls**:
   - API key visible in browser network tab
   - Consider moving to backend API for production
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Data Privacy**:
   - Job search queries not logged
   - No personal data sent to API
   - Application clicks tracked locally only

---

## üöß Known Limitations

1. **API Key Exposure**:
   - API key is client-side (visible in browser)
   - Recommendation: Move to server-side API proxy in production

2. **Job Data Source**:
   - Depends on jobs available in Google Talent Solution
   - Some searches may return limited results
   - Real job availability varies by region

3. **Question Generation**:
   - Rule-based algorithm (not AI-generated)
   - Questions are generic templates
   - Future: Use LLM to generate truly custom questions

---

## üéØ Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Ideas:
1. **AI-Powered Question Generation**:
   - Use GPT-4 or Gemini to analyze job descriptions
   - Generate truly customized questions
   - Include company research and role-specific scenarios

2. **Saved Searches**:
   - Save search criteria for later
   - Email alerts for new matching jobs
   - Favorites/bookmark system

3. **Application Tracking**:
   - Track which jobs user applied to
   - Interview status tracking
   - Follow-up reminders

4. **Advanced Filters**:
   - Salary range
   - Experience level
   - Remote/hybrid/onsite
   - Company size
   - Benefits

5. **Analytics**:
   - Popular search terms
   - Most generated interviews
   - Success rate tracking
