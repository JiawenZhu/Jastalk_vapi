# âœ… Implementation Complete: Interview Data Flow to AI Agent

## Status: READY FOR TESTING

The AI agent will now receive complete interview context including title, questions, difficulty, duration, and all other interview metadata.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Custom Pipecat Client Created
**File**: `/client/index.html` (and copied to `/src/jastalk_client/index.html`)

A complete WebRTC client that:
- âœ… Extracts URL parameters (interview_title, questions, difficulty, etc.)
- âœ… Displays interview details to user in a nice UI
- âœ… Connects to Pipecat bot via WebRTC
- âœ… Sends interview data to bot using `client.sendAppMessage()`
- âœ… Shows video feed and connection status

### 2. Server Configuration
**Status**: âœ… Pipecat server now serves custom client

```
Server: http://localhost:7860
Custom client: âœ… Mounted at /client
Original UI: âœ… Available at /playground
```

### 3. Data Flow Established
```
React App
  â†“ Passes interview data via URL params
ChatWithAgent Modal (iframe)
  â†“ Loads http://localhost:7860?interview_title=...&questions=[...]
Custom Client (index.html)
  â†“ Extracts params & displays interview info
  â†“ User clicks "Connect & Start Interview"
PipecatClient.connect()
  â†“ WebRTC connection established
RTVIEvent.Connected fires
  â†“ Triggers sendAppMessage()
Bot receives on_app_message
  â†“ Injects into LLM context
AI Agent has full interview context! âœ…
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Verify Server is Running

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl -s http://localhost:7860/client/ | grep "JasTalk Interview Agent"
```

**Expected**: Should see `<title>JasTalk Interview Agent</title>`

**If server not running:**
```bash
cd server/agent
uv run bot.py
```

Look for: `âœ… Custom Jastalk client mounted at /client`

### Step 2: Test Custom Client Directly in Browser

Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:7860/client/?interview_title=Senior+Software+Engineer&interview_difficulty=Hard&interview_duration=45&interview_questions=%5B%22Tell+me+about+yourself%22%2C%22What+are+your+strengths%22%5D
```

**Expected to see:**
- "JasTalk Interview Agent" title
- Interview Details box showing:
  - Role: Senior Software Engineer
  - Difficulty: Hard
  - Duration: 45 minutes
- Video container (black)
- "Connect & Start Interview" button

### Step 3: Test Through React App

1. **Start frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to interview:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3002
   - Click "Mock Interviews"
   - Select any interview (e.g., "Software Engineer - Google")
   - Click "Start Interview"

3. **Open chat:**
   - In interview page, click "Chat with JasTalk AI" button
   - Modal opens with iframe

4. **Grant permissions:**
   - Click "Allow" when browser asks for camera/microphone
   - You should see the custom client load inside iframe
   - Interview details should be displayed

5. **Connect:**
   - Click "Connect & Start Interview" button
   - Wait for status: "Interview started! Say 'Hey' to begin."

6. **Test agent knowledge:**
   - Say "Hey" or "Hello"
   - Agent should greet you
   - Agent should mention the specific role or interview type
   - Agent should have context about the questions

### Step 4: Verify Data is Being Sent

**Open browser console** (F12 â†’ Console tab)

Look for these logs:
```javascript
ðŸŽ¯ JasTalk Interview Agent loaded
ðŸ“Š Interview data: {interview_title: "Senior Software Engineer", ...}
âœ… Connected to bot
ðŸ“¤ Sending interview data: {template: "Senior Software Engineer", questions: [...]}
```

### Step 5: Check Bot Logs

**Server terminal** should show:
```
INFO: Received app message: {'template': 'Senior Software Engineer', 'questions': [...]}
```

## Verification Checklist

Run through this checklist to confirm everything works:

- [ ] âœ… Server is running on port 7860
- [ ] âœ… `curl http://localhost:7860/client/` returns custom client HTML
- [ ] âœ… Custom client loads in browser with interview params
- [ ] âœ… Interview details display correctly
- [ ] âœ… React app can open chat modal
- [ ] âœ… iframe loads custom client inside modal
- [ ] âœ… Camera/microphone permissions work
- [ ] âœ… "Connect & Start Interview" button works
- [ ] âœ… Browser console shows interview data being sent
- [ ] âœ… Agent responds with context about specific role
- [ ] âœ… Agent asks questions from interview template

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Custom client not loading

**Symptoms**: Iframe shows default Pipecat UI or blank page

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -l /Users/jiawenzhu/Developer/Jastalk_vapi/src/jastalk_client/index.html

# Restart server
pkill -f bot.py
cd server/agent
uv run bot.py

# Look for: "âœ… Custom Jastalk client mounted at /client"
```

### Issue 2: Interview data not showing

**Symptoms**: Interview details show "-" or "N/A"

**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify URL parameters are being passed
- Inspect `chatUrl` in React DevTools
- Make sure ChatWithAgent is passing all interview fields

### Issue 3: Agent doesn't know interview context

**Symptoms**: Agent asks generic questions, no mention of role

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console: Is `sendAppMessage` being called?
2. Check server logs: Is `on_app_message` receiving data?
3. Verify questions are being parsed as JSON array
4. Make sure connection is established before sending

### Issue 4: WebRTC connection fails

**Symptoms**: "Connection failed" error, no video

**Solution**:
- Grant camera/microphone permissions in browser
- Check if port 7860 is accessible
- Try opening http://localhost:7860/client/ directly
- Clear browser cache and reload

## What the Agent Receives

When user connects, the agent's LLM context gets this system message:

```
You are an AI Interviewer conducting a structured mock interview.
Ask one question at a time, listen fully, and be concise.
If answers are brief, ask one followâ€‘up; otherwise continue.
Never end the call on your own; the user will hang up.

INTERVIEW_TEMPLATE: Senior Software Engineer
LANGUAGE: en
QUESTIONS:
1. Tell me about yourself and your experience
2. What are your key strengths as a software engineer?
3. Describe a challenging project you worked on
... (up to 20 questions)
```

This gives the agent **full context** to conduct a proper interview!
